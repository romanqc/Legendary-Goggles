Hello all, 

This is a Processing program I created that allows you to move a point accross the screen.
While the point moves accross the screen, it will locate the closest point in a cloud of points.
Once it has located the closest point, it will draw a line connecting both points. This is similar
to Nearest Neighbors to point in a point cloud.
